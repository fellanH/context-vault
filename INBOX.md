Raw captures — ideas, features, bugs noticed, scope changes, anything.
**Never act on items here in the moment. Triage weekly into BACKLOG.md.**

To add an item mid-session without stopping current work:
→ Tell Claude: `capture: [your idea]`
→ Claude logs it here and returns to what it was doing.

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — [raw text]`

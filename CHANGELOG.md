# Changelog

All notable changes to context-vault are documented here.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Data import flexibility** — import entries from markdown, CSV/TSV, JSON, and plain text files or directories
  - CLI: `context-vault import <path>` with `--kind`, `--source`, `--dry-run`
  - REST: `POST /api/vault/import/bulk` and `POST /api/vault/import/file` on local server
  - Auto-detects ChatGPT export format
- **Export** — dump entire vault to JSON or CSV
  - CLI: `context-vault export [--format json|csv] [--output file]`
  - REST: `GET /api/vault/export` on both local and hosted servers
- **URL ingestion** — fetch a web page, extract readable content as markdown, save as vault entry
  - CLI: `context-vault ingest <url>` with `--kind`, `--tags`, `--dry-run`
  - MCP tool: `ingest_url` available to all AI agents
  - REST: `POST /api/vault/ingest` on both local and hosted servers
- **Account linking** — connect local vault to a hosted Context Vault account
  - CLI: `context-vault link --key cv_...`
  - Config reads `hostedUrl`, `apiKey`, `userId`, `email`, `linkedAt` from config.json
  - Env var overrides: `CONTEXT_VAULT_API_KEY`, `CONTEXT_VAULT_HOSTED_URL`
- **Bidirectional sync** — additive-only sync between local and hosted vaults
  - CLI: `context-vault sync` with `--dry-run`, `--push-only`, `--pull-only`
  - REST: `POST /api/local/sync`, `GET/POST /api/local/link`
  - Manifest-based diffing via `GET /api/vault/manifest`
- **Sync settings page** in web dashboard (`/settings/sync`)
- **CORS preflight** support on local server (OPTIONS handler + full CORS headers)
- 42 new unit tests for importers and URL ingestion (107 total)

### Fixed
- **`context-vault ui` now works after npm install** — pre-built web dashboard is bundled in the npm package via prepack; dual-path resolution falls back to workspace path for local dev

### New core exports
- `@context-vault/core/capture/importers` — Format detection + multi-format parsers
- `@context-vault/core/capture/import-pipeline` — Batch import orchestrator
- `@context-vault/core/capture/ingest-url` — URL fetch + HTML-to-markdown
- `@context-vault/core/sync` — Bidirectional sync protocol

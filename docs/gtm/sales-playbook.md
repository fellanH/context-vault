# Founder-Led Sales Playbook (Solo AI Dev ICP)

## Offer

- Free: onboarding + evaluation
- Pro: sustained usage, export, and higher limits

## Core Pitch

- Problem: AI sessions are stateless and repetitive.
- Value: Context Vault gives persistent memory through MCP in minutes.
- Proof: works with hosted MCP endpoint and open API key auth.

## Pipeline Targets (90 days)

- 50 qualified conversations
- 20 activation calls
- 10 direct conversion asks

## Demo Tracks

1. Local CLI flow (`context-mcp setup` + tools)
2. Hosted MCP flow (`/mcp` + API key)
3. Browser extension flow (search/inject/save)

## Objection Handling

- Privacy: user data stays in their vault; hosted data is isolated by API key account.
- Lock-in: markdown + API export support portability.
- Complexity: one endpoint (`/mcp`) plus copy/paste config.

# GTM Context — Context Vault

Read this file when working on marketing, sales, or content tasks. Not loaded automatically in dev sessions.

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

- Solo AI developers
- Technical founders shipping AI-powered products
- Small product teams using Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or GPT Actions

## Core Pitch

> AI sessions are stateless. Context Vault gives persistent memory through MCP in minutes.

## CTAs

- **Primary:** "Start free" → `appHref("/register")` (cross-origin to app)
- **Secondary:** "See 2-minute setup" → `/get-started`

## Content Pillars

1. **Integration** — Setup guides for specific AI clients (Claude Code, Cursor, GPT Actions, Windsurf)
2. **Playbook** — Practical workflows and use-case guides
3. **Education** — Deep dives on architecture, retrieval, taxonomy design
4. **Comparison** — Honest comparisons against alternatives (notes apps, static files, hosted-only tools)

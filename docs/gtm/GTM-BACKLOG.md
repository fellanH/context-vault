## Later

Parking lot. No commitment, no ordering.

- Discord community server
- Product Hunt launch
- Paid acquisition experiments (Reddit ads, Carbon ads)
- Campaigns B & C (drafts in `sales-assets.md`)
- CRO A/B tests on landing page
- Comparison landing pages (vs Mem, vs Obsidian, vs static .md files)

## Decisions

Key GTM choices. Reference, not action items.

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-20 | Content pieces tracked in `content-tracker.md`, not here | GTM backlog is for strategic/structural tasks. Individual blog posts, videos, and BIP updates stay in the content tracker to avoid duplication. |
| 2026-02-20 | GTM blitz before onboarding optimization | Need traffic to measure the funnel. Ship distribution first, then instrument and optimize. |
| 2026-02-20 | ICE scoring calibrated for GTM context | Impact = adoption/revenue lift. Confidence = user signal strength. Ease = session count to ship. |

## Cross-Reference: GTM Docs

How this backlog relates to other GTM docs in `docs/gtm/`:

| File | Relationship |
|------|-------------|
| `GTM-CONTEXT.md` | ICP, CTAs, content pillars — the strategic foundation this backlog executes against |
| `content-tracker.md` | Individual content pieces (blog, video, BIP). GTM backlog tracks the strategic tasks; content tracker tracks production status. |
| `weekly-log.md` | Execution journal. When a GTM backlog item ships, record it in the weekly log too. |
| `pipeline.md` | Founder-led sales CRM. GTM backlog may generate leads that flow into the pipeline. |
| `sales-playbook.md` | Core pitch and objection handling. Informs GTM backlog items like the pricing narrative. |
| `sales-assets.md` | Campaign drafts and collateral. GTM backlog items reference assets here; don't duplicate content. |
| `funnel-metrics.md` | Numeric targets. Instrumentation items in this backlog feed data into funnel metrics. |
| `assets/` | Campaign drafts (X threads, Reddit posts, HN posts). GTM backlog "Ship Campaign A" pulls from here. |
| `demos/` | Demo video scripts. GTM backlog "Record demo GIF" may reference scripts here. |

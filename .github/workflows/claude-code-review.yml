            Review this pull request for the context-vault monorepo (packages: core, local, hosted).

            Focus on:
            1. Logic errors and correctness
            2. Security issues (injection, auth bypass, data exposure, hardcoded secrets)
            3. Hardcoded constants that may exist elsewhere in the repo — grep for the value across all packages before assuming it's unique (duplicate constants are a known recurring issue)
            4. Missing test coverage for changed source files in packages/core, local, or hosted
            5. Scope creep — files modified outside the stated purpose of the PR

            Be concise. Post inline comments for specific line-level issues. End with a single summary comment: Approve / Request Changes / FYI only, with a one-line reason.

            Skip style nitpicks. Skip comments on test-only changes unless the tests themselves are wrong.

## What this is

Context Vault is about owning your data and storing it long term in a human readable format,  
it allow you to give any AI agent you use now or in the future persistent memory.
Anyone can install it into any workflow very easily and their agents remember things across sessions.

## Who it's for

Anyone using AI seriously — especially builders and small teams
who want local-first, no-cloud-dependency memory that actually works.
One of the primary user is me. If it doesn't solve my own daily workflow problems,
it doesn't ship.

## What success looks like

- Developers reach for it on day one of a new AI project
- Paying users within weeks of any meaningful release, not months
- Feedback that says "I use this every day" — not "this is interesting"
- Revenue that compounds: each new user finds it through another user

## What we don't compromise on

- Local-first: the core must work without a cloud account
- Speed of value: working in 2 minutes or it's too slow
- Simplicity over features: one thing that works beats five things that are fine
- Ship over perfect: real usage beats theoretical correctness every time

# Development Playbook

**Agent-operated. Human steers with session goals and feedback. Agents handle everything else.**

---

## The Full Cycle

```
HUMAN: session start prompt
        │
        ▼
AGENT reads NORTH-STAR.md
AGENT derives live state (git log, npm view, gh run list)
AGENT self-governance check → GO or HOLD
        │
        ▼ (GO)
AGENT: implement → commit → push to main
        │
        ▼
CI (automatic): test suite + conditional package builds
        │
        ▼
DEPLOY (automatic on CI pass): staging → health check → smoke → production
        │
        ▼
AGENT: updates BACKLOG.md
        │
        ▼
HUMAN: session wrap prompt
        │
        ▼
[NPM RELEASE — separate trigger]
cv-release-manager: version bump → CHANGELOG → git tag
publish.yml: npm publish + GitHub Release
```

No PRs. No branches by default. Push to main, CI and deploy handle the rest.

## What You Actually Do

### Session start
```
Session goal: [one sentence]
```
Agent reads NORTH-STAR.md, derives live state, surfaces summary, pitches approach.

### Session wrap
```
Session wrap.
```
Agent confirms what shipped, corrects BACKLOG.md, dumps any open items, tells you what's next.

### Feedback and capture (any time)
```
feedback: [what you experienced or noticed]
capture: [idea]
```
`feedback:` → FEEDBACK.md with [UX] or [DEV] tag — primary roadmap input
`capture:` → INBOX.md — ideas for triage

## Deployment Paths

| Package | Trigger | Target |
|---------|---------|--------|
| packages/core | bundled — no direct deploy | — |
| packages/local | git tag `v*` | npm |
| packages/hosted | main push (hosted or core changed) | Fly.io staging → prod |
| packages/app | main push (app or core changed) | Vercel staging → prod |
| packages/marketing | main push (marketing changed) | Vercel staging → prod |
| packages/extension | manual dispatch | Chrome Web Store |

**Versioning:** bump root + core + local + extension together. `packages/hosted` is 0.x — never bump with others.

**Deploy order:** staging → health check (30 retries / 5s) → smoke → production. Staging failure = production blocked.

## Session Prompts

### Engineering
```
Session goal: [outcome in one sentence]
```

### Quick fix
```
Fix [specific thing] in [file or package].
```

### Parallel agents (branch required)
```
Session goal: [outcome]
[N] independent tasks — confirm zero file overlap before spawning:
1. [Task A] — touches [packages/X] only
2. [Task B] — touches [packages/Y] only
Assign branches, spawn in parallel.
```

### Triage
```
Triage. No code.
Read FEEDBACK.md, INBOX.md, BACKLOG.md.
Process feedback into backlog items. ICE score. Re-score Next.
Tell me what to pull into Now.
```

### Release (npm)
```
Release. Type: [patch / minor / major].
Bump versions (root + core + local + extension — NOT hosted).
Update CHANGELOG. Tag and push.
```

### Session wrap
```
Session wrap.
```

### Strategic re-anchor
```
Lost the thread. No code.
Read NORTH-STAR.md, git log, BACKLOG.md.
Tell me: what's shipped, what's next, whether it serves the product direction.
```

### Planning before building
```
Think through [problem] before writing any code.
Read [relevant files]. Give me 2–3 approaches with trade-offs.
```

## Branching (exception, not default)

Default is main. Branch only for:
- Parallel agents working simultaneously (they'd conflict on main)
- Experimental work you might abandon

Branch naming: `feat/<scope>-<slug>` · `fix/<scope>-<slug>` · `chore/<slug>`
Scope: `marketing · hosted · cli · extension · core · infra`
Delete branches after merging.

## Agent Roster

| Agent | Owns | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| cv-site-dev | packages/marketing/ | |
| cv-content-writer | docs/gtm/, posts.ts | |
| cv-campaigns | docs/gtm/assets/ | |
| cv-sales-ops | docs/gtm/ pipeline files | |
| cv-release-manager | version + CHANGELOG | Clean main only |
| cv-test-runner | read-only | No commits |
| Claude CLI | any package | Default for all code |

---

## Parallelism Rules

Zero shared files = parallel-safe. One shared file = sequential.

**Safe in parallel:** marketing page + blog post, hosted fix + CLI change, unrelated test files

**Never parallel:** feature + its tests, two changes to packages/core, any feature + release, two agents on same package

When tasks share a dependency: build the shared thing first, then parallelize.

---

## CI/CD Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | What |
|----------|---------|------|
| ci.yml | push to main | Tests + conditional builds |
| deploy.yml | CI pass on main | Staging → health → smoke → prod (path-scoped) |
| publish.yml | tag `v*` | npm publish + GitHub Release + dogfood |
| publish-extension.yml | manual | Chrome Web Store |
| claude-code-review.yml | PR only | Inline review (for branch-based work) |
| claude.yml | @claude comment | Ad-hoc assistance |

---

## Sprint Tracking

BACKLOG.md `Now` = what's actively being built. Agents self-correct drift.

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Work started | Move to Now |
| Pushed to main | Move to Done |
| Abandoned | Move back to Next |

Hard cap: 3 in `Now`.

---

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Wrong branch | Session started without checking git status | Check git status at session start |
| Agents conflict | Parallel work on same files | Verify zero file overlap before spawning |
| Hosted wrong version | Bumped with core/local | hosted is 0.x, never bump with others |
| Extension not updated | publish-extension.yml needs manual dispatch | Run after tagging |
| Backlog out of sync | Agents skipped update | Session wrap corrects this |
| Backlog disconnected from reality | No feedback ingestion | Use `feedback:` regularly, run triage |
| npm install fails post-publish | Registry lag ~60s | `npm cache clean --force` then retry |

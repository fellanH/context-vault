Persistent memory for AI agents — saves and searches knowledge across sessions. Your data stays local as plain markdown files.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx context-vault setup
```

That's it. One command — no global install required.

Setup detects your AI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and more), downloads the embedding model (~22MB), seeds your vault, and configures MCP.

Then open your AI tool and try: **"Search my vault for getting started"**

**Prefer a permanent install?**

```bash
npm install -g context-vault
context-vault setup
```

## What It Does

- **Save** — insights, decisions, patterns, contacts. Your AI agent writes them as you work.
- **Search** — hybrid full-text + semantic search. Ask in natural language.
- **Own your data** — plain markdown in `~/vault/`, git-versioned, human-editable.

## MCP Tools

Your AI agent uses these automatically.

| Tool             | Description                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `get_context`    | Search vault (hybrid FTS + vector) |
| `save_context`   | Save or update entries             |
| `list_context`   | Browse with filters                |
| `delete_context` | Remove by ID                       |
| `ingest_url`     | Fetch URL, extract, save           |
| `context_status` | Health and config                  |

Entries are organized by `kind` (insight, decision, pattern, reference, contact, etc.) into `~/vault/knowledge/`, `~/vault/entities/`, `~/vault/events/`. Kind is derived from the subdirectory name.

## CLI

| Command                       | Description                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `context-vault setup`         | Interactive installer — detects tools, writes MCP configs |
| `context-vault connect --key` | Connect AI tools to hosted vault                          |
| `context-vault switch`        | Switch between local and hosted MCP modes                 |
| `context-vault serve`         | Start the MCP server (used by AI clients)                 |
| `context-vault status`        | Vault health, paths, entry counts                         |
| `context-vault reindex`       | Rebuild search index                                      |
| `context-vault import <path>` | Import .md, .csv, .json, .txt                             |

| `context-vault ingest <url>`  | Fetch URL and save as vault entry                         |
| `context-vault update`        | Check for updates                                         |
| `context-vault uninstall`     | Remove MCP configs                                        |

## Manual MCP Config

If you prefer manual setup over `context-vault setup`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-vault": {
      "command": "context-vault",
      "args": ["serve", "--vault-dir", "/path/to/vault"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Hosted Option

No Node.js required — sign up at [app.context-vault.com](https://app.context-vault.com), get an API key, connect in 2 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

**Install fails (native modules):**

```bash
npm rebuild better-sqlite3 sqlite-vec
```

On Apple Silicon, ensure you're running native ARM Node.js: `node -p process.arch` should say `arm64`.

**Stale search results:**

```bash
context-vault reindex
```

**Vault not found:**

```bash
context-vault status   # shows resolved paths
mkdir -p ~/vault
```
